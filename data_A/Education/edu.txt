DU to launch new registration portal for BTech courses, admissions via JEE Main score

The University of Delhi is preparing to launch the registration portal for its newly introduced BTech programs, as announced by Haneet Gandhi, the Dean of Admission, during an admissions webinar. Delhi University has introduced three BTech programs under the Faculty of Technology, and admissions to these programs will be based on the scores obtained in the Joint Entrance Examination (Main).

In addition to JEE scores, applicants must have scored at least 60% or above in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics combined. They should have also studied English as a subject and completed Class 12 from a recognized board. A total of 360 seats are available, with 120 seats per course. The three courses offered are BTech in Computer and Engineering, BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and BTech in Electrical Engineering.

Gandhi clarified that the registration process for these courses will be separate from the existing Common Seat Allocation System (CSAS). A new registration portal, distinct from CSAS, is expected to be launched next week. Students will be required to fill in their preferences during the application process, and seat allocation will be based on their scores and preferences.

It is important to note that these newly introduced courses are different from the BTech in Information Technology and Mathematical Innovation (IT and MI) program offered by the Cluster Innovation Centre (CIC) of the University. Admissions to the IT and MI program are conducted through the Common Seat Allocation System.

Furthermore, the University of Delhi will provide a financial support scheme for students from economically weaker sections. Students whose parental income is Rs 4 lakh or less will receive a 90% fee waiver at the time of admission, while students whose parental income falls between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 8 lakh will receive a 50% fee waiver. This initiative aims to make education more accessible and affordable for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
