Protest In Delhi's Mandawali Over Removal Of Temple Railing, AAP Minister Says 'Action Taken On Orders Of LG'

A protest erupted in Delhi's Mandawali area as locals expressed their discontent over the removal of a temple's railing, leading to the deployment of paramilitary forces and local police to maintain law and order. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (East Delhi), Amrutha Guguloth, clarified that the railing was removed as part of the Public Works Department's encroachment program. She assured that the law and order situation was normal during the protest.

Visuals from the scene showed a group of women protesters brandishing sticks and shovels while confronting the police, accusing them of misconduct. The protesters argued that there was no encroachment at the temple site and raised slogans of "Jai Shri Ram" (Hail Lord Ram) while praying in front of the temple. Local BJP councilor Ravi Negi was also present during the protest.

The anti-encroachment action was reportedly based on a complaint. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) engaged in a blame game, with Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdev accusing Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of displaying an "anti-Hindu face." On the other hand, Delhi Minister Atishi claimed that the removal was authorized by the Lieutenant Governor.

The Delhi PWD minister, Atishi, stated that the action was carried out based on the orders of the Lieutenant Governor and mentioned that the then-minister, Manish Sisodia, disapproved of all demolitions. The East Delhi District Magistrate, Anil Banka, clarified that the removed railing was not from the temple itself but had been constructed by some individuals on the footpath adjacent to the temple. He explained that the railing was blocking the way and its removal had been communicated beforehand, leading to some confusion.

The police reported that the protest did not cause any traffic disruptions and that the situation was under control. The removal of the temple's railing has sparked political controversy, with opposing parties trading accusations and providing differing accounts of the circumstances surrounding the action.
