Probe PM CARES, says Uddhav Thackeray amid ED action in jumbo Covid facility scam

In the midst of the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) recent actions against individuals associated with Uddhav Thackeray's party in an alleged jumbo Covid facility scam, the chief of the Shiv Sena (UBT) expressed his disapproval of the Central agency and called for an investigation into the PM CARES Fund. Uddhav Thackeray also demanded probes into the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, while additionally seeking an examination of the operations of the Nagpur, Pimpri-Chinchwad, and Pune civic bodies.

Uddhav Thackeray made these statements while addressing his party workers, specifically mentioning his request for an inquiry into the PM CARES Fund. He further challenged the government to investigate the functioning of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) during the pandemic. Unfazed by the ED's investigation, Uddhav Thackeray stated, "We are not scared of any probe. And when you (government) want to probe, then you also probe Thane municipal corporation, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, and Nagpur civic bodies."

He continued, "Probe the PM CARES Fund as well. The PM CARES Fund does not come under the ambit of any investigation. Lakhs and crores of rupees were collected. Many ventilators were malfunctioning. We will also carry out a probe," emphasizing the need to scrutinize the allocation and management of funds.

During the week, the Enforcement Directorate conducted searches at various locations associated with individuals believed to have close ties to Sanjay Raut and Aaditya Thackeray, prominent leaders of the Shiv Sena (UBT). Additionally, the central purchase department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) was also subject to scrutiny.
These developments have sparked a heated political debate, with Uddhav Thackeray's call for investigations into the PM CARES Fund and other governmental bodies adding fuel to the fire. As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how these investigations will progress and what impact they will have on the political landscape.
